# array-calc-rusty (Prototype)
  Same functionality as the last custom-operator-precedence project, except with more granular controls and efficient input and processing methods. I have decided to not implement any string functions for now though. Full documentation coming out soon.

### Usage:
  Currently implementing... I myself have no idea how I'll do it, but will push in the next week probably.
  
  #### Currently in mind:
  
  A normal user would have to call the solve(nums: Vec< f32 >, ops: Vec< u32 >, mode: u32) function. Apart from that, implement your own functions and create a standard file to set predence of the operators. Although, like the previous projects, some precedences are pre-fixed like the ')' or function ending char is set to 1, whereas the precedence for a comma(',') or a value seperator in functions is set to 2. Other than that it's pretty open.
  
  
  
  
##  Be back soon:
  I'll share the input style soon when I'm sure about it myself, although I can say that it is more efficient and easier than the last project.
  
  
# To-Do:
- [x] Arthemetic implementation.
- [x] Functions implementation.
- [ ] Unary function implementation(Seperate, can be done by the above for now).
- [ ] Logical function implementation and input.
- [ ] Tests for the above.
- [ ] Make into a CLI tool.
- [ ] Implement all important functions from statistics.
- [ ] Implement all important functions from trignometry.
- [ ] Implement all important functions for numeral conversion (Decimal, HexaDecimal, Octal, Binary, etc.)
- [ ] Implement all important conversions for masses, volumes, angles, etc.
